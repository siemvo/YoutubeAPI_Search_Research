## YouTube Search Research using YouTube Data API v3
This project utilizes the YouTube Data API v3 to perform search query research using Jupyter Notebooks. The analysis explores various factors affecting video performance, such as video duration, title keywords, subscribers, and tags.

I created this pipeline to do search research to find out how I can optimize video performance in relevant search queries. I collected data from the search queries using the YouTube API and looked into correlations between relevant features and views.
